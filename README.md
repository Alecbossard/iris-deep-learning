# Iris Flower Classification using Deep Learning ðŸŒ¸

This project uses a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). The code is structured to be modular and easy to understand, separating data processing, model architecture, and training logic.

## ## Project Structure

-   `/data`: Contains the raw `iris_data.csv` dataset.
-   `/src`: Contains all the Python source code, organized into modules.
    -   `config.py`: Central file for all hyperparameters and settings.
    -   `data_loader.py`: Handles loading and preprocessing the data.
    -   `model.py`: Defines the neural network architecture.
    -   `train.py`: Main script to execute the model training.
    -   `evaluate.py`: Script to load a saved model and evaluate its performance.
-   `/models`: Directory where the trained model weights are saved (e.g., `iris_model.h5`).
